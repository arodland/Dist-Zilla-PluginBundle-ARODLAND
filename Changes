Version 0.03: 2011-11-09
  * Use # AUTHORITY and # VERSION comments (OurPkgVersion) so that line
    numbers are stable.
  * Add 'compat' option to act like a given version. compat = 0.02 will
    make VERSION and AUTHORITY act like 0.02.
  * Add 'no_MakeMaker' option to suppress the dzil MakeMaker plugin so I
    can use another one.

Version 0.02: 2011-08-18
  * First intentional release, with correct git handling.

Version 0.01: 2011-08-17
  * Accidentally released an incomplete version to CPAN. Amusing, since
    this is the module I'm using to manage my release process.
